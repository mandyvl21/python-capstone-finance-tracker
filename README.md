How to run the script:
First, save the Python file as finance_tracker.py. Then, open your terminal or command prompt of choice, navigate to the directory where this Python file is saved (using cd to change directories), and then run the python file by typing "python finance_tracker.py".

Python concepts used:
- Functions: multiple functions were used to create the framework for how the program runs
- Dictionaries and tuples: an expense_dict dictionary was used to store the expenses and their respective categories, with each expense being a value in the dictionary that is a tuple of (expense description, expense amount)
- While and for loops: used to execute code an unknown amount of times so that the user can continue using the program until they are satisfied
- Try/except blocks: to ensure code integrity when asking the user for inputs to add expenses to the expense_dict dictionary
